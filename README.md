# LAOS Evolution Solochain

For a comprehensive understanding of the LAOS system, please refer to the [LAOS Technical Whitepaper](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-whitepaper/blob/main/laos.pdf), which extensively covers all components.

The LAOS Evolution Solochain is a specialized chain constructed on Polkadot, focusing primarily on the minting and evolution of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).

## Run your own Node

You can start and sync the evolution node locally with the following command:
```
$ docker run freeverseio/laos-evolution-node:<release> --chain=arrakis
```

## Networks
